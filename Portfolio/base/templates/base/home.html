					<h4>My Journey in COGNIZANCE</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I joined COGNIZANCE in Jan'21 in the open source domain, where I did a bunch of preliminary and mainstream tasks to get familiar with the concepts, tools and technologies used in open source.</p>

					<p>Few month into the club I participated in my first hackathon, Surfs' UP Hackathon where in I built Beaches and Blues.</p>

					<p>From there I went on to participating in HackMIT and Hack The North both as a hacker and a mentor, and there is a lot to come</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the Club I’m ready to learn something new. I'll collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & youtube channel.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
